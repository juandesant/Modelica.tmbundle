# Modelica.tmbundle
TextMate bundle for Modelica and OpenModelica language hightlighting, folding, etc

This repository here is the result of an automatic conversion from Sublime Text to TextMate

The original Sublime Text package created by @BorisChumichev. is here:

https://github.com/BorisChumichev/modelicaSublimeTextPackage

The Sublime Text to TextMate conversion was done using the `ant` script and XML/XSL files from:

https://github.com/srbs/textmate-to-sublime-converter

Credits for that conversion script go to @srbs.

A step-by-step guide on how to use those scripts to generate and use a TextMate bundle can be found in this project's wiki

Installation instructions can also be found on the wiki.
